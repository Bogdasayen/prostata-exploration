* PSA validation
** Validation of microsimulation PSA-testing by age and psa
 + Compared with STHLM0, the microsimulation has too many low PSA (PSA<3) and too few high
   PSA (PSA>3); this is true for both testing proportions
   and test rates.
 + In summary, there is evidence that high PSA values are
   under-represented in the microsimulation. This is predicated on the
   STHLM0 data being correct; there is reasonable face validity with
   other data sources, although we note that direct comparisons are
   not straightforward.

** PSA sub-model validation with external code
 + Re-running the PSA longitudinal sub-model separately, we found that
   a high proportion of men aged 70+ years had PSA 10+; in contrast,
   the simulation for "screenUptake" had few men with PSA 10+ for the
   older men. This did not restrict for previous prostate cancer diagnosis.
 + This could be partial explained by a loss of high PSA
   values due to earlier diagnosis.

** Comparison with NHANES data
 + STHLM0 looked reasonable compared to the American data. A direct
   comparison was difficult, as the NHANES was a survey of healthy
   men, while the STHLM0 is based on men who were tested (or
   re-tested) for prostate cancer; men who had a low PSA test prior to
   2003 may be under-represented by the men tested since 2003. This is
   an interesting estimation problem -- that is, how can we estimate
   cross-sectional estimates from testing data?

**  Comparing PSA testing proportions
 + NHANES compared with parameter (cancer onset)
 + First test, fixes 10<PSA<inf indicating that discrepancy seen in
   for when not restricting to first test could be explained with retesting.
 + revised_natural_history=FALSE
** Checks undertaken
 + Re-extracted the PSA data from the original large
   SAS dataset (OK)
 + Re-ran the STHLM0 extraction (OK)
 + Re-ran the microsimulation (OK)
 + Checked that the microsimulation parameters are as per the FHCRC C
   code (OK)
* Survival validation
** DONE Rider 2015
 + Code at [[~/src/ki/diagnoses/surviavalByDiagnosis.R][~/src/ki/diagnoses/surviavalByDiagnosis.R]]
*** DONE Add CI-bars to the point estimates, line break legend 2*3
 + Result at
 [[~/src/ki/diagnoses/survivalByRiskAgePlusRider.pdf]]
** DONE PcBase survival extract
 + Code at [[~/src/ki/diagnoses/surviavalByDiagnosis.R][~/src/ki/diagnoses/surviavalByDiagnosis.R]]
 + Result at
 [[~/src/ki/diagnoses/survivalPcBase.pdf]]
** DONE Calibrate stage-shift model using PcBase survival	    :Andreas:
   The stage-shift model is now used as the default model. This was
   done using mean(log(HR(t=10)),log(HR(t=15))) where t is the time
   since diagnosis. Code here: [[~/src/ki/diagnoses/PCbaseHR.R]]
   Calibration result here:
   [[~/src/ki/diagnoses/stage_shift_calibrated.pdf]]
** TODO Calibrate lead-time based using PcBase survival		    :Andreas:
   This has not been successful so far.  Code here:
   [[~/src/ki/diagnoses/PCbaseHR.R]] Calibration result here:
   [[~/src/ki/diagnoses/lead_time_calibrated.pdf]]
* TODO Biomarker model at PSA 10+				       :Mark:
  Consider whether men with PSA 10+ will do a S3M test. This has costs
  implications, but may also have clinical relevance.
* TODO PSA uptake patterns					       :Mark:
  Look at Mariotto paper for psa uptake patterns. We could also look
  at the Australian Medicare data for an age-specific test pattern.
* TODO Switch the time notation					       :Mark:
  Mark complains about the use of t0, tc, tmc and tm. At some point,
  it would be good to chance these to age_0, etc.
* DONE New base model for the biomarker				    :Andreas:
  New base model for the biomarker where we draw a random sample
  within the same group (uninformed of PSA-value). Keeping the PSA
  based model as an option.
* TODO Report incidence & mortality in tables 			    :Andreas:
  Produce incidence & mortality tables similar to how they are
  reported in table 6 & 7 in the IHE report.
