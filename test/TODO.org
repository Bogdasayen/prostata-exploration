* PSA validation
** Validation of microsimulation PSA-testing by age and psa
 + Compared with STHLM0, the microsimulation has too many low PSA (PSA<3) and too few high
   PSA (PSA>3); this is true for both testing proportions
   and test rates.
 + In summary, there is evidence that high PSA values are
   under-represented in the microsimulation. This is predicated on the
   STHLM0 data being correct; there is reasonable face validity with
   other data sources, although we note that direct comparisons are
   not straightforward.
** PSA sub-model validation with external code
 + Re-running the PSA longitudinal sub-model separately, we found that
   a high proportion of men aged 70+ years had PSA 10+; in contrast,
   the simulation for "screenUptake" had few men with PSA 10+ for the
   older men. This did not restrict for previous prostate cancer diagnosis.
 + This could be partial explained by a loss of high PSA
   values due to earlier diagnosis.
 + Code in test/test_microsimulation.R
** Comparison with NHANES data
 + STHLM0 looked reasonable compared to the American data. A direct
   comparison was difficult, as the NHANES was a survey of healthy
   men, while the STHLM0 is based on men who were tested (or
   re-tested) for prostate cancer; men who had a low PSA test prior to
   2003 may be under-represented by the men tested since 2003. This is
   an interesting estimation problem -- that is, how can we estimate
   cross-sectional estimates from testing data?
** Checks undertaken
 + Re-extracted the PSA data from the original large
   SAS dataset (OK)
 + Re-ran the STHLM0 extraction (OK)
 + Re-ran the microsimulation (OK)
 + Checked that the microsimulation parameters are as per the FHCRC C
   code (OK)
* Survival validation
** DONE Rider 2015
** TODO PcBase survival extract
