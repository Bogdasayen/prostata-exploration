* PSA validation
** Validation of microsimulation PSA-testing by age and psa
 + Compared with STHLM0, the microsimulation has too many low PSA (PSA<3) and too few high
   PSA (PSA>3); this is true for both testing proportions
   and test rates.
 + In summary, there is evidence that high PSA values are
   under-represented in the microsimulation. This is predicated on the
   STHLM0 data being correct; there is reasonable face validity with
   other data sources, although we note that direct comparisons are
   not straightforward.
 + Code at [[~/src/ki/STHLM0/PSArateByAge.R][~/src/ki/STHLM0/PSArateByAge.R]]
 + Result at
   [[~/src/ki/STHLM0/psaRatesByPSA.pdf]]

** PSA sub-model validation with external code
 + Re-running the PSA longitudinal sub-model separately, we found that
   a high proportion of men aged 70+ years had PSA 10+; in contrast,
   the simulation for "screenUptake" had few men with PSA 10+ for the
   older men. This did not restrict for previous prostate cancer diagnosis.
 + This could be partial explained by a loss of high PSA
   values due to earlier diagnosis.
 + Code at [[~/src/ki/microsimulation/test/test_microsimulation.R][~/src/ki/microsimulation/test/test_microsimulation.R]]
** Comparison with NHANES data
 + STHLM0 looked reasonable compared to the American data. A direct
   comparison was difficult, as the NHANES was a survey of healthy
   men, while the STHLM0 is based on men who were tested (or
   re-tested) for prostate cancer; men who had a low PSA test prior to
   2003 may be under-represented by the men tested since 2003. This is
   an interesting estimation problem -- that is, how can we estimate
   cross-sectional estimates from testing data?
 + Code at [[~/src/ki/NHANES/PSA_distribution.R][~/src/ki/NHANES/PSA_distribution.R]]
**  Comparing PSA testing proportions
 + NHANES compared with parameter (cancer onset)
 + First test, fixes 10<PSA<inf indicating that discrepancy seen in
   for when not restricting to first test could be explained with retesting.
 + revised_natural_history=FALSE
** Todo: Validate PSA uptake 1995-2003 				    :Andreas:
Do a big run (e.g. 1e8 or 1e9) and validate the incidence
1995-2003. If incidence is ok psa uptake should could be ok as
well. Start by checking old validation.
** Checks undertaken
 + Re-extracted the PSA data from the original large
   SAS dataset (OK)
 + Re-ran the STHLM0 extraction (OK)
 + Re-ran the microsimulation (OK)
 + Checked that the microsimulation parameters are as per the FHCRC C
   code (OK)
* Survival validation
** Done: Rider 2015

*** Done: Add CI-bars to the point estimates, line break legend 2*3

** Done: PcBase survival extract
 + Code at [[~/src/ki/diagnoses/surviavalByDiagnosis.R][~/src/ki/diagnoses/surviavalByDiagnosis.R]]
 + Result at
 [[~/src/ki/diagnoses/survivalPcBase.pdf]]
** Done: Calibrate stage-shift model using PcBase survival	    :Andreas:
   The stage-shift model is now used as the default model. This was
   done using mean(log(HR(t=10)),log(HR(t=15))) where t is the time
   since diagnosis. Code here: [[~/src/ki/diagnoses/PCbaseHR.R]]
   Calibration result here:
   [[~/src/ki/diagnoses/stage_shift_calibrated.pdf]]
** Todo: Calibrate lead-time based using PcBase survival		    :Andreas:
   This has not been successful so far.  Code here:
   [[~/src/ki/diagnoses/PCbaseHR.R]] Calibration result here:
   [[~/src/ki/diagnoses/lead_time_calibrated.pdf]]
* Todo: Biomarker model at PSA 10+				       :Mark:
  Consider whether men with PSA 10+ will do a S3M test. This has costs
  implications, but may also have clinical relevance.
* Todo: PSA uptake patterns					       :Mark:
  Look at Mariotto paper for psa uptake patterns. We could also look
  at the Australian Medicare data for an age-specific test pattern.
* Todo: Switch the time notation					       :Mark:
  Mark complains about the use of t0, tc, tmc and tm. At some point,
  it would be good to chance these to age_0, etc.
* Done: New base model for the biomarker			    :Andreas:
  New base model for the biomarker where we draw a random sample
  within the group 3<psa<10. And randomly (uninformed of PSA-value)
  adjust for the rFPR. The PSA based model is kept as an option.
* Todo: Compare the two biomarker models
* Todo: Report incidence & mortality in tables		    :Andreas:
  Produce incidence & mortality tables similar to how they are
  reported in table 6 & 7 in the IHE report. This needs to be re-done
  since we changed thresholds for the biomarker panel.
* Done: Re-run the psa-threshold for the biomarker model 	    :Andreas:
  After the calibration of the gleason specific prevalence we needed
  to re-run the thresholds for the PSA based biomarker-model. This
  will have to be redone again if we update the PSA-uptake model for
  1994-2003.  This lead to a slight change in thresholds, diff:
  #+BEGIN_SRC R :exports code :eval no
    -    PSA_FP_threshold_nCa=4.4, # reduce FP in no cancers with PSA threshold
    -    PSA_FP_threshold_GG6=3.6, # reduce FP in GG 6 with PSA threshold
    +    PSA_FP_threshold_nCa=4.15, # reduce FP in no cancers with PSA threshold
    +    PSA_FP_threshold_GG6=3.41, # reduce FP in GG 6 with PSA threshold

** PSA historic testing                                               :Mark:
+ PSA uptake compare with Jonsson 2011
+ Poisson-likelihood?
+ PSA testing by PSA-value
     [[~/src/ki/STHLM0/psaRatesByPSA.pdf]]
+ Re-testing younger ages (Medicare > 65)
+ Model of all PSA-testing based on PCa incidence in Stockholm.
+ Use STHLM0, 2003-now, to get PSA re-testing patterns per integer
  year and age (PSA-value?). Use start of uptake to year-be-year
  introduce possible retesting.
+ Question :: What do we do with the PSA-values for the missing data
     1993-2003? Can we assume something reasonable or should/can we
     skip the PSA-dependence?

*** Additional stories
This could be additional angles in the paper or separate publications.
1) Reconstruct overall PSA-testing in Swedish counties using observed
   PCa prevalence.
2) Reconstruct overall PSA-testing in Great Britain using observed
   PCa prevalence.
+ Question :: Can we do predictions on uptake & re-testing using
     STHLM0 data on these other regions?
